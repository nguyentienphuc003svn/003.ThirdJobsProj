
2.14 Give a grammar and an example if statement for each of the following languages: 
(a) Perl, 
Conditional:
	"if" Cond "then" Block "end"
	| "if" Cond "then" Block "else" Block "end"

Example:	
if ($x > 10) {
	print "$x is greater than 10!";
} else {
	print "$x is not greater than 10!";
}
print "<br />";	



(b) Python, 
if_stmt ::=  "if" expression ":" suite
             ( "elif" expression ":" suite )*
             ["else" ":" suite]

Example:
if temperature > 70:
    print('Wear shorts.')
else:
    print('Wear long pants.')
print('Get some exercise outside.')
	

			 
(c) Ada.
if_statement ::= 
      "if" condition "then" 
      sequence_of_statements 
      { "elsif" condition "then" 
      sequence_of_statements } 
      [ "else" 
      sequence_of_statements ] 
      "end" "if" ";"
	  
Example:	  
if Temperature >= 40.0 then
    Put_Line ("Wow!");
    Put_Line ("It's extremely hot");
elsif Temperature >= 30.0 then
    Put_Line ("It's hot");
elsif Temperature >= 20.0 then
    Put_Line ("It's warm");
elsif Temperature >= 10.0 then
    Put_Line ("It's cool");
elsif Temperature >= 0.0 then
    Put_Line ("It's cold");
else
    Put_Line ("It's freezing");
end if;
